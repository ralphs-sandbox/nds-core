/**
 * @brief Represents a state machine to be attached to a node.
 *
 * Attach the state machine to a node by using Node::addChild().
 *
 * The state machine provides a <b>local state</b> and a <b>global state</b>:
 * - the local state represents the state of a single state machine
 * - the global state takes into account all the state machines attached to
 *   the children nodes (the state with the higher priority)
 *
 * In EPICS the state machine PVs will be available as "StateMachine-setState"
 *  (set the state) and "StateMachine-getState" (to retrieve the state).
 * The PV "StateMachine-globalState" represents the global state (state
 *  with higher priority among the current node and all its children).
 *
 * Transitions between the different states can happen on the same
 *  thread that requested the transition or on a different thread when
 *  the StateMachine is created with the bAsync flag set to true.
 *
 * The StateMachine node also registers the following commands on the
 *  state machine node itself and on the parent node:
 * - switchOn (causes a transition to the state ON)
 * - start (causes a transition to the state RUNNING)
 * - stop (causes a transition to the state ON)
 * - switchOff (causes a transition to the state OFF)
 * - recover (causes a transition to the state OFF)
